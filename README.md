# Feathers

Feathers is a stamina mod that serves as an API for all my future projects

## Installation

Simply drag and drop the mod downloaded from the files section [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/feathers/files) into your mods folder after installing [Minecraft Forge](files.minecraftforge.net).
The mods folder is located at  ```%appdata%/.minecraft/mods```.

## Developer Information

Adding support to Feathers is easy. To import it, simply add this line to your ```build.gradle``` file's ```repositories```.

```gradle
repositories {
     maven { url "https://www.cursemaven.com" }
}
```
And this to your project's dependencies.
```gradle
dependencies {
	implementation fg.deobf("curse.maven:feathers-699933:FILE_VERSION") 
}
```
Where ```FILE_VERSION``` is the file ID of the version you want to use. You can find this by opening the URL of an Feathers file download and looking at the url. The numbers at the end are the file ID.

Then simply run your gradle setup commands as normal, e.g. ```gradlew genEclipseRuns``` then ```gradlew eclipse```.

You now have access to Feathers API and code! The API is pretty self explanatory but if you need any help, feel free to private message me [here](https://www.curseforge.com/members/elenaidev/followers)!
